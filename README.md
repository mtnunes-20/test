## :ocean: Introduction

The F-Boat Project is an innovative initiative resulting from the collaboration between two universities, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) and Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) with the aim of developing an autonomous sailboat, whose function is to monitor the waters of Guanabara Bay. This technology emerged due to the increase of environmental demands and it represents a vanguard initiative on the marine and environmental field.

### :fire: Motivation

The motivation for developing the F-Boat is driven by the critical need to monitor and preserve the waters of the bays and lagoons. This initiative is rooted in the commitment to environmental sustainability and the understanding of the importance of water quality for the health of marine ecosystems and the quality of life of local communities.

### :construction_worker: Multidisciplinary Team

The F-Boat project benefited from the expertise of a diverse group of:
 - researchers;
 - students;
 - faculty from the Departments of Electrical Engineering (TEE-UFF);
 - faculty from Water Resources and Environmental Engineering (TGH-UFF);
 - the Institute of Computing (IC-UFF);
 - team from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).

### :+1: Partnerships

The F-Boat project received crucial financial support from institutions and entities committed to scientific and technological research, including:
- Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)
- Niterói City Hall
- Marinha do Brasil (brazilian navy)
- nVidia, a world leader in Artificial Intelligence solutions and high-performance embedded computing systems.

## :construction: Development and Construction

The construction of the F-Boat was a complex task that required specialized skills and experience in naval engineering. The construction process began in Natal, RN, and is ongoing in the city of Niterói, RJ. Some of the notable features of this autonomous sailboat include:
- [Advanced Monitoring](https://github.com/medialab-fboat/water-sensors-code): The F-Boat is equipped with state-of-the-art technology for monitoring water conditions, allowing the collection of valuable data for environmental studies.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI): The partnership with nVidia enabled the incorporation of AI systems to enhance the autonomy and performance of the F-Boat.

- [Automation](https://github.com/medialab-fboat/actuators-code-just-arduino-mega-version): The F-Boat project is a tangible demonstration of UFF's commitment to investing in technologies with integrated systems that interact with each other.


- [Computer Vision](https://github.com/medialab-fboat/Yara_OVE): In partnership with artificial intelligence, computer vision will enable the F-Boat to interpret images and videos, empowering it to perform tasks such as object recognition and visual pattern detection.

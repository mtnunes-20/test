## :ocean: Introduction

The F-Boat Project is an innovative initiative resulting from the collaboration between two universities, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) and Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) with the aim of developing an autonomous sailboat, whose function is to monitor the waters of Guanabara Bay. This technology emerged due to the increase of environmental demands and it represents a vanguard initiative on the marine and environmental field.

### :fire: Motivation

The motivation for developing the F-Boat is driven by the critical need to monitor and preserve the waters of the bays and lagoons. This initiative is rooted in the commitment to environmental sustainability and the understanding of the importance of water quality for the health of marine ecosystems and the quality of life of local communities.

## :construction: Development and Construction

The construction of the F-Boat was a complex task that required specialized skills and experience in naval engineering. The construction process began in Natal, RN, and is ongoing in the city of Niterói, RJ. Some of the notable features of this autonomous sailboat include:
- Advanced Monitoring: The F-Boat is equipped with state-of-the-art technology for monitoring water conditions, allowing the collection of valuable data for environmental studies.
